# UW-Java-Programming-Coursework-Projects
## Coursework and projects from computer programming courses related to programming in Java and data structures & algorithms at the University of Washington

### Data Structures and Algorithms:
Demonstration of fundamental algorithms and data structures for implementation. Study and projects related to techniques for solving problems by programming using linked lists, stacks, queues, directed graphs, trees (representations, traversals), searching (hashing, binary search trees, multiway trees), garbage collection, memory management, and internal/external sorting.

### Advanced Java Programming II:
Continuation of Intermediate Java Programming with labs and projects examining concepts of data abstraction and encapsulation including stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, recursion, instruction to complexity, and use of predefined collection classes.

### Intermediate Java Programming I:
In labs and projects, covers concepts of procedural programming (methods, parameters, returns, and values), basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for/while loops), file processing, arrays, and an introduction to defining objects.
